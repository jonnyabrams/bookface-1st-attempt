# Bookface

This is a Facebook clone built using the MERN stack. It has a React frontend, a Node/Express backend and a MongoDB database storing data for users and posts.

Users can create an account, sign in, post, follow/unfollow other users, like/unlike each others' posts and - soon, I hope! - send each other private messages.

(Video demo coming soon)

## Improvements I would like to make

Work on this is ongoing. My next priority is to make it possible for users to edit their profile as I have done on my [Twitstagram](https://github.com/jonnyabrams/twitstagram) project. As mentioned before, I also plan to implement live chat funcionality using Socket.IO.
